# UI Components Playground ðŸ§ª

Experimenting with **Storybook**, **Chromatic**, and **Figma Connect**

This repository is a small playground to try out the integration of:

-   [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) â€“ UI component explorer & docs
-   [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) â€“ cloud publishing & visual regression tests
-   [Figma Connect](https://help.figma.com/hc/ja/articles/360045003494-Storybook%E3%81%A8Figma) â€“ link design to live components

## Purpose

This is not a production â€“ just a sandbox to learn how these three tools connect and how they improve designâ€“dev workflow.

## Annotation

This project requires a `.env` file at the root with the following:

```
CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
